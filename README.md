Implemented Neural Style Transfer using VGG19 pre-trained weights to extract features from content and style
 images, achieving artistic image synthesis by merging content from one image with the stylistic elements from another.
 Implemented algorithms for computing content and style costs based on methodologies from Gatys et al.'s 2015.
 Enhanced NST by integrating style costs from multiple layers with adjustable weights for balanced style blending.
